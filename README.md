# Reinforcement Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** learning repository! This repo is a collection of my **notes, projects, and experiments** as I explore the exciting field of RL. The purpose of this repo is to document my progress, learnings, and hands-on applications of RL algorithms. Whether you're a beginner or experienced in the field, feel free to browse, explore, and even contribute to this learning journey.

## üöÄ About This Repo

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Introduction to RL**: A basic overview of reinforcement learning, its core concepts, and the algorithms used.
- **Projects**: Various projects that showcase practical implementations of RL techniques like Q-Learning, DQN, Policy Gradient Methods, etc.
- **Notes**: A detailed collection of notes that I‚Äôve gathered while studying RL. These will include theoretical concepts, important papers, key algorithms, and challenges faced while working on projects.

## üìö Contents

### 1. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**
- What is Reinforcement Learning?
- Key Concepts: Agent, Environment, States, Actions, Rewards
- Types of Learning: Model-free vs Model-based
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Exploration vs Exploitation

### 2. **Projects**
